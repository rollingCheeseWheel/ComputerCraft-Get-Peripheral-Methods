# Get Peripheral Methods
Use this CC / CC: Tweaked program to get all the methods of a specific peripheral, which can be accessed by CC / CC: Tweaked

# Getting Started
Use the "pastebin" command in a ComputerCraft terminal
1.  `pastebin get Ss9B90Rn getPeripheralMethods`
2.  `edit getPeripheralMethods`
3.  Change the "peripheralType" in the first line of the program. If you don't know the type of the peripheral, exit the file, then type `lua` and `peripheral.getType(<side>)`. `<side>` is the side to which the peripheral is relative to the computer

Or download the file and put it in you CC / CC: Tweaked computers folder, then follow the steps `2` and `3`
